### What is Monkey?

Monkey is a programming language that *you can build yourself* by reading
through <a href="https://interpreterbook.com">Writing An Interpreter In Go</a>
and <a href="https://compilerbook.com">Writing A Compiler In Go</a>.

There is no official implementation of Monkey â€” it lives in these books and it's
up to you, the reader, to implement it. First as a tree-walking interpreter,
then as a bytecode compiler and virtual machine.

It looks like this:

```javascript
// Monkey has integers & arithmetic expressions...
let version = 1 + (50 / 2) - (8 * 3);

// ... and strings
let name = "The Monkey programming language";

// ... booleans
let isMonkeyFastNow = true;

// ... even arrays & hashes
let people = [{"name": "Anna", "age": 24}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 99}];

// It also has functions!
let getName = fn(person) { person["name"]; };
getName(people[0]); // => "Anna"
getName(people[1]); // => "Bob"

// Combined with conditionals, implicit and explicit returns and the fact that
// functions can be recursive gets you this:
let fibonacci = fn(x) {
  if (x == 0) {
    0
  } else {
    if (x == 1) {
      return 1;
    } else {
      fibonacci(x - 1) + fibonacci(x - 2);
    }
  }
};

// And the crown jewel in every Monkey implementation:
// 
// closures!
// 
// `newAdder` returns a closure that makes use of the free variables `a` and `b`:
let newAdder = fn(a, b) {
    fn(c) { a + b + c };
};
// This constructs a new `adder` function:
let adder = newAdder(1, 2);

adder(8); // => 11
```

Monkey Programming Language written in Rust. Including *compilation to WASM* and an *online playground*
{{< /monkey-implementation >}}

{{< monkey-implementation "skx" "monkey" "Go">}}
This repository started life as the implementation written by gaufung, but it has now diverged significantly in terms of both features and implementation. Including:

* File I/O
* A standard library
* Postfix operators

{{< monkey-implementation "Rydgel" "monkey-rust" "Rust" />}}
{{< monkey-implementation "utatti" "monkey-rs" "Rust" />}}

{{< monkey-implementation "ronnieholm" "MonkeyLang" "C#" >}}
This repository contains a C# port of the Monkey programming language from the Writing an interpreter in Go book. Its code closely resembles that presented in the book, but written in idiomatic C# for the .NET Core runtime. Using the instructions below, the interpreter runs on both Windows, Mac, and Linux.

{{< monkey-implementation "geovanisouza92" "geo" "Go" >}}
The **geo** programming language based on Monkey.

Special features:

* All functions are curried
* Scopes lives on blocks, no name clashes
* Pipe operator: the result of one expression becomes the last argument on a subsequent function call expression
* Unicode support
